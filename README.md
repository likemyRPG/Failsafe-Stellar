# Failsafe: Summary

Failsafe is a smart contract solution built on Stellar's Soroban platform, designed to provide secure and automated estate planning for crypto assets. By leveraging Stellar's fast, low-cost infrastructure and Soroban's Rust-based smart contracts, we've created a system that ensures your digital assets are protected and properly distributed in case of unexpected events.

## Problem Statement

**Problem**: Many individuals hold crypto assets but face two critical risks:

1. **Key Loss**: Users frequently lose access to their private keys through device failure, forgotten passwords, or lost seed phrases. Industry research estimates over 20% of all Bitcoin (worth billions) is permanently inaccessible due to lost keys.

2. **Unexpected Incapacitation**: If a holder becomes suddenly inactive or incapacitated, their assets remain locked without a contingency plan. Typical solutions involve manually sharing private keys or partial custody, which is insecure, cumbersome, and prone to human error.

**Solution**: **Failsafe** addresses both issues by:

- Creating a "safety net" that automatically detects user inactivity on-chain and transfers funds to chosen beneficiaries
- Providing passkey-based authentication to eliminate seed phrase and private key management completely
- Allowing recovery through a "revive window" if the user regains access
- Requiring simple "check-ins" rather than complex key management

**Intelligent Distribution**: Our solution offers two distribution methods:
1. **Direct Assignment**: Manually select specific beneficiaries for your assets
2. **AI-Powered Distribution**: Let our intelligent system analyze your life events, online presence, and relationship data to automatically adjust beneficiary allocations based on changing circumstances in your life

This AI-driven approach ensures your assets are distributed according to your current life situation, even if you haven't manually updated your beneficiary list recently.

## User Base

1. **Crypto Holders**: People who want an on-chain contingency plan for their assets.
2. **Estate Planners**: Families or beneficiaries to ensure seamless asset transfer if the holder is unavailable.
3. **Developers**: Projects that need an inactivity-based fallback or vault mechanism in their dApps.

## Impact

* **Prevent Permanent Key Loss**: Eliminates the risk of permanently losing access to crypto assets due to lost or forgotten private keys by using passkey authentication instead.
* **Secure Estate Transfer**: Ensures crypto assets aren't lost in the event a user can no longer manage their wallet, whether due to death, disability, or extended absence.
* **User-Friendly**: Simple "check-in" function that can be triggered from a front-end or even automatically via reminders or push notifications.
* **No Third Party**: Everything is enforced by a Soroban (Stellar) smart contract, removing the need to trust an intermediary.

## Why Stellar? (Featuring Passkeys)

* **Soroban**: Stellar's new smart contract platform is fast, low-fee, and developer-friendly.
* **Passkeys**: We leverage [**Passkey Kit**](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit) to let users sign and authenticate quickly, **replacing** cumbersome private keys with FIDO2/WebAuthn-based passkeys. This eliminates the risk of lost seed phrases or private keys entirely.
* **Seamless UX**: By using **Passkeys** and **Launchtube** for frictionless wallet creation, users can manage their "Failsafe" with just a few tapsâ€”no need to store a separate seed phrase or private key that could be lost.
* **Worldwide Reach**: Stellar's payment rails allow beneficiaries to move funds or swap them into local currencies easily.

## Experience Building on Stellar

We found **Soroban** straightforward to work with once we:

* Understood the no_std environment in Rust.
* Learned about the changes from classic SDK usage to Soroban's approach (e.g., referencing addresses, local storage, events).
* Experimented with **Launchtube** for quick test deployment on the standard Testnet.
* Integrated **Passkeys** for user authentication.

The steep Rust learning curve and limited developer tooling compared to EVM chains (like hardhat, foundry, or ethers.js) presented initial challenges, but the documentation and examples helped us overcome these hurdles.

Overall, the developer ecosystem is evolving rapidly, and we overcame some version mismatch issues but ended up with a robust solution.

## Components

1. **Soroban Contract** (`dead-mans-wallets/src/lib.rs`):
   * Manages user state, inactivity detection, triggers, finalization.
   * Emits events for register, check_in, trigger, revive, finalize.
   * Stores user data in persistent storage keyed by user address.

2. **Frontend (Next.js)** (`src/app/`):
   * Integrates **Passkeys** (via [kalepail/passkey-kit](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit)) for user authentication.
   * Calls the contract's register/check_in/finalize methods with `js-stellar-sdk`.
   * Displays the current user's status, next check-in deadline, etc.

3. **Backend**:
   * Used for fast response times on frontend while keeping everything in sync with contract

## Design Choices

* **Storage**:
  * We store `UserData` in Soroban's contract storage keyed by `Address`.
  * This ensures all logic is on-chain, no external DB needed for core features.
* **Events**:
  * We emit events (`register`, `check_in`, `trigger`, `revive`, `finalize`) to enable off-chain monitoring or indexing.
* **Passkeys Implementation**:
  * We rely on `passkey-kit` for FIDO2-based key creation and signing.
  * This simplifies user login while letting them sign Soroban transactions without manually handling private keys.
* **Challenges Overcome**:
  * **Reference-types** issues while compiling. We disabled them for Soroban.
  * **No `env.caller()`** in older Soroban SDK versions. We pass user addresses explicitly.
