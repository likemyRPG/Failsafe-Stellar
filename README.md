# Dead Man's Wallet: Summary

## Problem Statement

**Problem**: Many individuals hold crypto assets but worry about "What happens if I suddenly become inactive or incapacitated?" Typically, that risk is mitigated by manually sharing private keys or partial custody. This is insecure, cumbersome, and prone to human error.

**Solution**: **Dead Man's Wallet** automatically detects user inactivity on-chain and transfers their funds to a chosen beneficiary if they fail to "check in" within a specified timeframe. A "revive window" allows the user to cancel the process if they become active again.

## User Base

1. **Crypto Holders**: People who want an on-chain contingency plan for their assets.
2. **Estate Planners**: Families or beneficiaries to ensure seamless asset transfer if the holder is unavailable.
3. **Developers**: Projects that need an inactivity-based fallback or vault mechanism in their dApps.

## Impact

* **Secure Estate Transfer**: Eliminates worry about lost crypto in the event a user can no longer manage their wallet.
* **User-Friendly**: Simple "check-in" function that can be triggered from a front-end or even automatically via reminders or push notifications.
* **No Third Party**: Everything is enforced by a Soroban (Stellar) smart contract, removing the need to trust an intermediary.

## Why Stellar? (Featuring Passkeys)

* **Soroban**: Stellar's new smart contract platform is fast, low-fee, and developer-friendly.
* **Passkeys**: We leverage [**Passkey Kit**](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit) to let users sign and authenticate quickly, **replacing** cumbersome private keys with FIDO2/WebAuthn-based passkeys.
* **Seamless UX**: By using **Passkeys** and **Launchtube** for frictionless wallet creation, users can manage their "Dead Man's Wallet" with just a few tapsâ€”no need to store a separate seed phrase or private key.
* **Worldwide Reach**: Stellar's payment rails allow beneficiaries to move funds or swap them into local currencies easily.

## Experience Building on Stellar

We found **Soroban** straightforward to work with once we:

* Understood the no_std environment in Rust.
* Learned about the changes from classic SDK usage to Soroban's approach (e.g., referencing addresses, local storage, events).
* Experimented with **Launchtube** for quick test deployment on the standard Testnet.
* Integrated **Passkeys** for user authentication.

Overall, the developer ecosystem is evolving rapidly, and we overcame some version mismatch issues but ended up with a robust solution.

## Components

1. **Soroban Contract** (`dead-mans-wallets/src/lib.rs`):
   * Manages user state, inactivity detection, triggers, finalization.
   * Emits events for register, check_in, trigger, revive, finalize.
   * Stores user data in persistent storage keyed by user address.

2. **Frontend (Next.js)** (`src/app/`):
   * Integrates **Passkeys** (via [kalepail/passkey-kit](https://github.com/kalepail/passkey-kit)) for user authentication.
   * Calls the contract's register/check_in/finalize methods with `js-stellar-sdk`.
   * Displays the current user's status, next check-in deadline, etc.

3. **Backend**:
   * Used for fast response times on frontend while keeping everything in sync with contract

## Design Choices

* **Storage**:
  * We store `UserData` in Soroban's contract storage keyed by `Address`.
  * This ensures all logic is on-chain, no external DB needed for core features.
* **Events**:
  * We emit events (`register`, `check_in`, `trigger`, `revive`, `finalize`) to enable off-chain monitoring or indexing.
* **Passkeys Implementation**:
  * We rely on `passkey-kit` for FIDO2-based key creation and signing.
  * This simplifies user login while letting them sign Soroban transactions without manually handling private keys.
* **Challenges Overcome**:
  * **Reference-types** issues while compiling. We disabled them for Soroban.
  * **No `env.caller()`** in older Soroban SDK versions. We pass user addresses explicitly.
