# Why Failsafe?

## The Problem We're Solving

In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, we've identified two critical challenges that affect millions of users:

1. **Lost Access**: Billions of dollars worth of crypto assets are permanently inaccessible due to lost private keys, forgotten passwords, or misplaced seed phrases. This isn't just a technical issueâ€”it's a real problem affecting real people's financial security.

2. **Unplanned Absence**: When crypto holders become unexpectedly unavailable (due to death, disability, or extended absence), their digital assets remain locked away, potentially causing significant financial hardship for their loved ones.

## Our Solution

Failsafe is a smart contract solution built on Stellar's Soroban platform that provides:

- **Automated Safety Net**: Automatically detects user inactivity and transfers funds to designated beneficiaries
- **Keyless Security**: Uses modern passkey authentication instead of traditional private keys
- **Revival Window**: Allows users to reclaim their assets if they regain access within a grace period
- **Simple Check-ins**: Requires only periodic check-ins rather than complex key management
- **Intelligent Distribution**: Offers both manual beneficiary selection and AI-powered distribution based on life events
